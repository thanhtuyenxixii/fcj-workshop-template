## 06/07/2026 - 12/07/2026

**Work mode:** Individual implementation combined with group-based learning and discussion.
**Program:** Workforce Bootcamp - First Cloud AI Journey.
**Mentor:** No fixed mentor assigned; work was self-managed and supported by documentation, tutorials, and peer discussion.

## Objective

Train the first scoring model and evaluate it with metrics that prioritize risky-run detection and hallucinated-success detection.

## Context

After feature engineering, the project needed a supervised model that could turn tabular behavior features into a decision signal. XGBoost was selected because it works well for structured tabular data and is supported by SageMaker.

## AWS Learning Focus

This week focused on model training concepts on AWS and the practical limitation of student-account quotas. I studied the intended SageMaker Training workflow before deciding to use local XGBoost as a fallback.

- **SageMaker Training purpose:** Learned that SageMaker Training runs model training jobs on managed infrastructure and writes trained artifacts back to S3.
- **Built-in XGBoost:** Reviewed SageMaker support for XGBoost and why it fits tabular classification tasks.
- **Training input channels:** Studied how training and validation CSV files from S3 are passed into a training job.
- **Training output artifact:** Reviewed how a completed training job normally produces model artifacts stored in S3.
- **Instance type selection:** Learned that training jobs require available ML instance quotas, which can differ by account and Region.
- **AWS Service Quotas:** Checked the quota limitation and recorded that the student account could not run the planned managed training job.
- **Local fallback:** Used local XGBoost training to keep the project moving while documenting SageMaker Training as planned but unavailable.
- **Evaluation focus:** Studied why safety-oriented metrics such as risky recall and false-negative rate are more meaningful than accuracy alone for a risk-scoring project.

This week demonstrates that I studied the AWS managed training path first, then made an implementation decision based on real account constraints rather than presenting an inaccurate result.

> **Historical state of this week:** The `ap-southeast-1` Training quota was unavailable during Week 6, so local XGBoost kept the project moving. After a separate `ml.m5.large` quota was approved in `us-east-1`, managed Training later completed in Week 8. The screenshots below remain valid evidence of the Week 6 decision, not the final managed lifecycle.

## Daily Breakdown

| Date | Work performed |
|---|---|
| 06/07/2026 | Prepared processed CSV files for model training and selected XGBoost for tabular classification. |
| 07/07/2026 | Attempted to align training with SageMaker Training and checked account quota limitations. |
| 08/07/2026 | Used local XGBoost training as the fallback path when managed training quota was unavailable. |
| 09/07/2026 | Generated evaluation metrics including accuracy, macro F1, risky recall, and false-negative related metrics. |
| 10/07/2026 | Packaged model outputs and verified the model artifact folder. |
| 11/07/2026 - 12/07/2026 | Captured evaluation, model artifact, and quota screenshots for honest MVP documentation. |


## Technical Activities

- Prepared the training data from the processed CSV files and selected target labels for classification.
- Aligned the planned workflow with SageMaker Training, while documenting that managed training quota was blocked in the student AWS account.
- Used local XGBoost training as the practical fallback so the project could still produce a model artifact and continue to endpoint deployment.
- Evaluated accuracy, macro F1, risky recall, risky false-negative rate, and hallucinated-success recall, with emphasis on false negatives because missing risky behavior is more serious than flagging a run for review.

## Deliverables

- **XGBoost model trained locally.**
- **Evaluation report produced.**
- **Week 6 quota limitation documented; managed retry deferred to a later week.**
- **Model artifact prepared for packaging.**

## Challenge and Solution

**Challenge:** The AWS account quota prevented the intended SageMaker Training job, so the project had to avoid pretending that managed training was completed.

**Solution:** The report preserves local training as the honest Week 6 fallback. Managed SageMaker Training is recorded later, when the separate `us-east-1` quota became available and the job actually completed.

## Project Relevance

This week contributed to the final MVP by strengthening the path from **AI coding-agent behavior evidence** to an **AWS-based risk scoring workflow**. The work helped ensure that the final workshop is not only a conceptual explanation, but also follows the actual implementation sequence used in the project.

The screenshots show the local XGBoost evaluation result, the generated model artifact, and the SageMaker Training quota evidence that explains why local training was used as the practical fallback.
